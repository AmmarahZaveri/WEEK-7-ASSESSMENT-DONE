Take note of the timing result:
Results for the extraLargeArray
insert 979.449 ms
append 5.257 ms
Results for the tinyArray
insert 6.4 μs
append 5.6 μs
Results for the smallArray
insert 10.3 μs
append 5.5 μs
Results for the mediumArray
insert 119.6 μs
append 35.2 μs
Results for the largeArray
insert 7.0986 ms
append 223.9 μs

As you can see the timing results for calling all the functions with all of the differently sized arrays
(tinyArray, smallArray, mediumArray, largeArray, and extraLargeArray) are all different
I can easily compare the different values for the timers in relation to the size of the array that was passed into each function.
